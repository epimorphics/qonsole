v 2.0.0

* Using ResizeObserver instead of MutationObserver
* Using transition states to coordinate modal & overlay transitions (previously if overlay transition was longer than
modal transition weird stuff was happening)
* Using prettier
* Overlay is not a parent of the modal anymore
* Renamed Event.stop => Event.cancel
* Removed `v--modal-background-click` element
* Removed `v--modal` default class
* Removed "delay" property - component is relying on modal & overlay transition durations
* Added naive implementation of focus trap
* Added source-maps
* Added `hideAll` for dynamic modals
* Fix: dialogs not working when componentName is changed
* Fix: ActiveElement is blurred after before-open is fired - not it is possible to cache document.activeElement
